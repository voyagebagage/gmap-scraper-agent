# Walkthrough: Walkthrough Organization

I have organized the project's documentation and execution results into a dedicated folder.

## Changes Made

### 1. Folder Structure
- Created `walkthroughs/` in the project root.
- Added `results/` subdirectory for execution outputs.
- Added `media/` subdirectory for screenshots and recordings.

### 2. File Organization
- Moved `places_results.json` from `.tmp/` to `walkthroughs/results/` for better visibility and permanence.

### 3. Documentation
- Updated [README.md](file:///Users/sedatif2/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/wat-agent-template/README.md) to include the new folder in the project structure.
- Mirrored agent artifacts (`task.md`, `implementation_plan.md`, `walkthrough.md`) into the `walkthroughs/` folder.

## Verification Results

- [x] Directory `walkthroughs/` exists.
- [x] Subdirectories `results/` and `media/` exist.
- [x] `README.md` updated and linked.
- [x] Scraping results moved to `walkthroughs/results/`.
- [x] Documentation mirrored for easy access.
